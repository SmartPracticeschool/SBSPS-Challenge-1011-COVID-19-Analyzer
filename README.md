## ABOUT COVID ANALYZER

The Covid Analyzer is a one stop dock where people's emotions are brought into limelight by gathering their tweets and thus analysing their sentiments; taking into consideration each individuals perspective.

Covid 19 has created a major impact on our day to day lives. Extension of lockdown has caused a variety of mixed emotions which are released in a common hub.People feel free to emote here,which results in the boom of social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram , Facebook etc.The goal of "The Covid Analyzer" is to understand their reactions towards this pandemic.

The way people express themselves during lockdown and the way they react to the Covid pandemic is very well captured by their feeds. A machine learning model which uses NLP(Natural Language Processing) to enact these sentiments in the stage, is a well reaching solution to this pandemic. This solution helps people analyse each individual's views pertaining to not only the lockdown,but also about the generalised views of Covid as such. Clustering is inbuilt to show the different emotions expressed by people with respect to a single domain. Each country's individual response is also captured and data analysis based on the language is determined. The approach towards the analysis is first supervised and later made as a hybrid terrain. The comments, likes for each post, verified accounts , followers count and even the no. of favourites of each comment is analysed and the model is trained respectively. Ultimately this model is trained to make people aware  about the effects, Covid 19 has caused and the mixed reactions each individual has towards it, in different countries.
